What started as a niche mobile platformer has since evolved into one of the biggest indie game communities ever. Most turn away from the game after the first few official levels, but there is an entire online community that many never get to see.

It is easy to look at a level like Stereo Madness and think "is that all this game has to offer?" Well, a quick trip into the level editor, featured levels, and gauntlets will tell you otherwise. The game features a vast array of gamemodes, triggers, decorations, themes, styles, and creativity that no other game has.

The goal for {{ site.title }} is to share some of the endless stories this game has to offer, from help guides to in-depth player experiences. Geometry Dash is more than what the first dozen levels give it credit for, and hopefully through this website, you can figure that out and see for yourself just how big of a game this is.
