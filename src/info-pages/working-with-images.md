For any images that are part of your article, you will need to compress them, get a link to them, and provide us with the link. You will have at least one image associated with your article, being the cover image.

# Compressing images

The image associated with your article and images that are part of your article content must be compressed. Here are some tools to compress images:

* [imagecompressor.com](https://imagecompressor.com/)
* [iloveimg.com/compress-image](https://www.iloveimg.com/compress-image)

Ideally, an image should be less than 600 kB.

# Getting a link to your image

Once your image is compressed, you will need to get a link to it. There are many online services that you can share your image on, one of which is [imgur](https://imgur.com/).

[Upload your compressed image to imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) (anonymously if you can) to get a shareable link. After you upload an image, you may be prompted to create an account. You do not have to, just use your browser's back button to go back to your uploaded image and copy the link.

# Using images in your articles

If you are just using an image for the article's cover, then just provide that link when you submit the article (there is a field to do so). However, if you are using images inside the content of your article, how you provide the image links depends on how you write your article.

1. If you are writing in markdown, simply just use the image link with the image syntax.
2. If you are writing in a document editor such as Google Docs, provide a link to the image underneath each instance of it.
3. If you are writing in any other text editor that does not support images and are not using markdown syntax, just paste a link to the image where you would want it to be.
