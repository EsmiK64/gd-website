The goal is for all content on this website to be of the utmost quality for our readers. Because of this, articles that do not meet these standards may not be published. To increase the chances of your article getting published, please follow these standards closely.

# Format and Content

Articles on this website are written in **markdown**. Here is a [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to help you with its syntax. If this is your first time using markdown, take a look at this [tutorial](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). If you have absolutely zero clue where to start, check out [this 10 minute course](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

Likewise, articles contain **metadata,** such as its title, description, etc. Filling as much of this out as you can is greatly appreciated because otherwise our editors will have to do it.

Please see the [syntax and components](/syntax-components/) page.

## Format Rules

* Use elements as they are meant to be used. For example, only use blockquotes for quotes.
* Do not use quotation marks in blockquotes.
* Avoid using [curly quotes](https://writer.com/blog/curly-quotes/). While useful in most formal writing, they are not wanted here due to their confusing nature.
* When integrating blockquotes, credit the source before or after the blockquote. If you want to credit the source inside the blockquote, see the [syntax and components](/syntax-components/) page.
* Use bold and italics sparingly.
* Bold should be used to draw attention to important terminology.
* Italics should be used to emphasize a word or short sentence.
* Use the correct heading level. Start with a level 1 heading and work your way down.
* While you can technically use up to six levels of headings, it is recommended to not go past three.
* Use ordered lists when listing steps. Otherwise use unordered lists.
* Using lists to display content is highly recommended as it breaks up long paragraphs nicely.
* Use links to cite sources.
* Avoid using accordions inside other accordions.
* Use images in articles sparingly.
* When adding bolding, italics, and links, leave the punctuation marks untouched.
* Don't feel obligated to use certain features, even common ones such as headings and italics.

## Metadata Rules

Ideally, at the very least you should provide a title, description, and image with the article.

* The title should be descriptive and not generic. For example, "The History of Bloodbath" can instead be titled "How Bloodbath Shaped Modern Extreme Demons."
* The description should be only 1-2 sentences long and can either be a preview from the article (the first couple sentences) or a brief summary.
* A link to a thumbnail image should be provided. Make sure you are not infringing on anyone's copyright!

## Images

The image associated with your article and images that are part of your article content must be compressed. Here are some tools to compress images:

* [imagecompressor.com](https://imagecompressor.com/)
* [iloveimg.com/compress-image](https://www.iloveimg.com/compress-image)

Ideally, an image should be around 100-200 kB.

Once your image is compressed, [upload it to imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) (anonymously if you can) to get a shareable link. After you upload an image, you may be prompted to create an account. You do not have to, just use your browser's back button to go back to your uploaded image and copy the link.

# Citing Sources

Ideally, any and all facts in your article should be cited. This is usually done by using a link to reference the source, but if you have a lot of sources, you can reference them all at the end via a sources section. For more information, see the "Citing Sources Example" on the [syntax and components](/syntax-components/) page.

If a fact is considered **common knowledge**, it probably does not need a source. These usually include simple facts like the following examples:

* "Stereo Madness is the first official level"
* "RobTop is the creator of Geometry Dash"
* "Viprin is number one on the creators leaderboard"

In general, assume your reader has basic knowledge of well-known levels, players, and YouTubers.

Just because you think you know a fact doesn't mean it is common knowledge. In general, all bold claims should be sourced properly, like the following examples:

* "In order to become an in-game mod, you need to have connections"
* "1st Level by Real Storm is the first uploaded level"
* "Chill Out by TheRealDarnoc is the first rated level"

## Why should you cite your sources?

While citing your sources is not mandatory (except for specific circumstances), doing so has some benefits.

* If a fact you use is wrong, you will be less at blame.
* It can provide extra context to the reader.
* The article will generally be considered of a higher quality, which might increase its chances at being published or featured.

Because this website is not an academic resource, citing your sources is not mandatory **as long as** the source you are using is not directly stolen from someone else's work and infringing on their copyright. If this is the case, it must be credited.

## What sources should you use?

Here are some recommended sources for citing your facts.

* Geometry Dash Wiki pages
* Geometry Dash Forums
* YouTube videos
* Tweets
* A level's or creator's GDBrowser page
* Official statements from players

# Copyright

Make sure your article does not infringe on anyone's copyright. Be sure you are allowed to use any images used in your article and to credit quotes.

# Writing Style

Writing style is relatively open but do follow these general guidelines.

* Generally write in the second person (with some exceptions).
* Keep your writing style kind and motivating. You want the reader to feel encouraged after reading your article.
* Assume the reader has basic knowledge of well-known levels, players, and YouTubers.
* Use first person pronouns (such as "I" and "Me") sparingly.
* Keep your writing style professional. Avoid too many unrelated jokes.
* Avoid using ALL CAPS to emphasize words. Use italics or bolding instead.

# Topics

Avoid generic topics. If the topic you choose is more basic such as a list or level review, try and make it more in-depth so it can stand out.

## Topic Rules

Any topic is allowed as long as it is related to Geometry Dash, is interesting, and is appropriate for our audience. It is a good idea to talk with website editors about a topic before writing an article on it. Some good topic ideas are as follows:

* Interesting stories regarding levels and players.
* In-depth tutorials on interesting concepts.
* Analysis on levels and player careers.
* Personal experiences that are worth sharing.
* Case studies on projects such as mega collabs.
* Commentary on community events, but only if they are long-term enough.

Topics should also be "long-term." By this, it means they should stay relevant for a long period of time, so avoid writing about fads unless they will last a while.

Topics should also contain enough content for a 500-2000 word article, as stated later.

This website has support for multiple authors per an article, so if you want to write with someone, you can. This is best for case studies or reviews where multiple people contribute.

## Categories

If your topic falls under any of these categories, it may be eligible to be placed in the respective category. The categories to aim for are as follows.

* Featured — For more high quality articles. More details can be found later in this article.
* Video — For articles that contain a YouTube video counterpart.
* News — For new events happening in-game. Potential topics for these are content posted in the #news channel of the [Geometry Dash Discord server]().
* Guide — For instructional articles on how to achieve a task.
* History — For articles that tell the story of a historic player, team, or level.
* List — For a type of article that uses a list format. These are typically very generic so try and put more thought into this type of content.
* Review — For detailed reviews and critiques of levels, creators, and videos.
* Opinion — For solely opinion based articles.
* Theory — For articles solely based on theories where very little is confirmed.

Remember that an article doesn't need to fit in any of these categories to get published. If you want to write about a topic that won't fit in any of these categories, you can still write it.

# Quality

As previously stated, articles on this website are supposed to be of a really high quality. Follow these quality guidelines when writing your article.

* Articles should be around 500-2000 words long — depending on the topic. Any longer and it may be worth breaking it up into multiple articles.
* Excessive typos, grammar errors, bad wording, and unprofessional writing should be avoided.
* Avoid adding unecessary filler just to make your article longer. Choose topics that have enough content to meet the recommended word length.

# Featured Articles

The featured status is reserved for articles that master all standards mentioned on this page and go above and beyond the typical article on this website. These are displayed on the website homepage and sidebar. They are also generally used as examples of the kind of content we want on this site.

Most importantly, featured articles should be **interesting**, so the topic you choose is arguably the most important aspect of getting your article featured. Articles on famous players or events are therefore more likely to get featured than others.

Similarly, shorter articles (less than 1000 words) are less likely to get featured. Try and provide your reader with a lot of interesting content.

Website staff are ultimately the ones who determine which articles recieve, don't recieve, or get removed of the featured status.

# Help

If you have any questions, feel free to ask an editor.

# Terms

Ultimately, all decisions about what articles are published are made by the website staff. Even if your article follows all of the described guidelines, staff reserve the right to not publish it. Likewise, staff reserve the right to publish articles that do not follow all of these guidelines. For more details, [see this page](/how-to-post-an-article).
