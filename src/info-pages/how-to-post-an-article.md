So, you want to post an article on our website... Great! This page will explain to you how to do so and the process required.

# Standards

The standards for what we look for in articles are important, so [please give them a read](/article-standards/)! If your article does not meet these standards, we might not be able to work with it.

# Submit An Article

<!-- Currently, we are only accepting submissions from a few selected individuals. However, we plan to open up submissions to more people in the future. -->

You can submit an article through [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/SqZuGCpHMm). Share a link or text file of your article with a website Editor.

# Editing Process

If we choose to move forward with your article, it will be reviewed and edited by our editors.

# Posting

Once both you and our editors agree on a final article, it will be published on the site! If this is your first article, you will need to provide some information so we can make a profile for you.

## Profile

If you are publishing an article for the first time, we will need to make you a profile. You will need to give us the following information.

* The username that you want your article to be published under.
* A link to your profile picture that will be displayed next to your username.
* A short one sentence bio (optional).
* Your YouTube (optional).
* Your Twitch (optional).
* Your Twitter (optional).
* Your Discord server code (optional).
* Your in-game username (optional).

Along with the list above, you will need to come up with a unique identifier that will be used in the link to your profile. This **cannot be changed,** so please choose wisely!

# Terms

Ultimately, the website staff have the final say in whether or not your article is submitted, edited, or published. Even if you followed everything here correctly, the final say belongs to the staff. The staff also reserve the right to remove any articles if they see fit.
