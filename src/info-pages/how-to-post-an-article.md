So, you want to post an article on our website... Great! This page will explain to you how to do so and the process required.

# Standards

The standards for what we look for in articles are important, so [please give them a read](/article-standards/)! If your article does not meet these standards, we might not be able to work with it.

# Submit An Article

<!-- Currently, we are only accepting submissions from a few selected individuals. However, we plan to open up submissions to more people in the future. -->

<!-- You can submit an article through [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/SqZuGCpHMm). Share a link or text file of your article with a website Editor. -->

You can submit a complete article draft through [this form](https://forms.gle/9gTYoM4JzjyUwUBg7). A complete article draft is a finished article where all that is left to do is get an editor to edit it. If we choose to move forward with your article, it will be edited and published. We are more likely to move forward with your article if it follows the author handbook closely.

We as editors understand that you put a lot of hard work into your article, so we will never entirely rewrite it. The most we will do is the following.

* Fix grammar and spelling errors.
* Rewrite confusing sentences.
* Restructure article format (such as amount of paragraphs).
* Fix misuses of article [syntax and components](/syntax-components/).

If your article requires more than the above list, we likely will not be able to move forward with it.

# Profile

If you are publishing an article for the first time, we will need to make you a profile. When filling the above linked form, you will need to give us the following information.

* An author ID used in the URL to your profile. This **cannot** be changed.
* The username that you want your article to be published under.
* A link to your profile picture that will be displayed next to your username.
* A short one sentence bio (optional).
* Your YouTube (optional).
* Your Twitch (optional).
* Your Twitter (optional).
* Your Discord server code (optional).
* Your in-game username (optional).

# Editing Process

If we choose to move forward with your article, it will be reviewed and edited by our editors.

# Posting

After your article is edited and approved, it will be published on the site!

# Terms

Ultimately, the website staff have the final say in whether or not your article is submitted, edited, or published. Even if you followed everything here correctly, the final say belongs to the staff. The staff also reserve the right to remove any articles if they see fit.
