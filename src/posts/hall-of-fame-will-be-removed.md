RobTop shared with us a few pictures and a video of a 2.2 montage, which includes the updated online menu, updated treasure room, and the first look of the "Map." However, the updated online menu concept is considered by many to be one of the best new features.

If you look at the updated online menu carefully, you may notice that there's something missing. The Hall of Fame has been removed removed. Forunately, RobTop explained his decision to remove it.

RobTop states that the Hall of Fame is a "useless" feature.

Back in 2017, 2.1 was released and the Hall of Fame came along with it. But now, once 2.2 is released, a new tab called the "Safe" will replace it. This tab will allow you to play previous daily and weekly levels, but it won't give you the bonus rewards.

In other news, RobTop claims he will not add any more features to 2.2 because there is enough right now. He also states that he is planning to release 2.2 this year.
