The long awaited Geometry Dash 2.2 update has been previewed for up to 5 years at this point, which is absolutely crazy to think about! Anyhow, in August of 2021, RobTop announced that he would be premiering a 2.2 sneak peek after nearly 1 and a half years. He announced it on Geometry Dash's 8th birthday, as a special thanks to the community. This came out of nowhere, and had the community at it's tiptoes. However, we haven't had a 2.2 release since then.

**Disclaimer:** This is just a theory, not factual. Take everything you see here with a grain of salt, as it's only a theory, and nothing else. Enjoy! 
{% endalert %}

With the fastly approaching 22nd of February, 2022, on Tuesday, many people in the community have theorized about a possible 22nd of February, 2022 release date, since it's the nearest day with the most 22's in it. RobTop hasn't really ever announced a possible release date, but this could be an exception, once and for all. I mean, think about it, we got a sneak peek! Although it's probably not an official trailer, it's still progress nonetheless. 

Also, over the past few months, RobTop has been quite quiet with news, besides the new stat reveal a few days ago. This probably means he's polishing up features and bugs, possibly finishing the update. This could be proven by the fact that he usually clarifies that he's just fixing up bugs after long droughts with no 2.2 news.

> All this news is really exciting because there's been a draw of it lately, but finally in this past week, RobTop's been going crazy with the leaks, so I'm livin' for it! I can feel it, 2.2 has got to be close!

Vortrox also mentions the fact that 2/22/2022 is the perfect two's day, featuring seven different two's in one day, which will probably be the record for millenniums! (Context: 2/22/2222 is on a Saturday.) Anyway, thanks for reading my theory.
