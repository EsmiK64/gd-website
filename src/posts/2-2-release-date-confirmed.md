After over 5 years of waiting, RobTop confirmed a release time for Geometry Dash 2.2. RobTop comfirmed in the [Geometry Dash Discord server](https://discord.gg/geometrydash) that 2.2 is planned to release this year, although not giving a specific day. This means the update should release sometime between February to December.

![RobTop confirms that the plan is for 2.2 to release this year](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/392087938239954950/942907008754004048/unknown.png)

This perfectly aligns with the [predicted release date I came up with](/posts/2-2-release-date/) in January, so needless to say, my prediction was correct.

It is important to note that this is not a set-in-stone release date as much as it is a plan. As is evident with 2.2's development so far, RobTop's plans often fail. However, given how much progress he has been revealing as of late, this is probably one of the times RobTop sticks to his word.

There are 10 months left in the year. This should give RobTop more than enough time to finalize the update and release it after half a decade of the community's patience. Once the update is finally released, what do you plan to do?
