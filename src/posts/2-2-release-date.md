Unlike popular belief, Geometry Dash 2.2 is not coming out on Tuesday February 22, 2022. That is a myth created because of the date's similarity to the update's name. In fact, there is no confirmed release date for 2.2. Historically, updates get released as they get finished, so the same is likely to happen with 2.2. However, given update leaks and the official [sneak peek](https://youtu.be/ipK7vQ8gEZw), we can estimate as to how much longer the update will take to release.

Assuming RobTop has nothing left to add and is just fine-tuning the current upcoming features, the update can release anywhere between 2-12 months from now. Of course, this depends on the current state of the update. If RobTop is just fixing bugs, it may release in just a month or two from now. But if RobTop still has core parts of new features to develop, it may take longer.

Ultimately, 2.2 will likely release in 2022. But as for how early or how late in the year is unknown. Nevertheless, 2.2 is by far the biggest update the game has ever seen and will definitely be worth the long five year wait.
