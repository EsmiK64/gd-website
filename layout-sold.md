On March 1st 2022, Just a GD Player, a Russian youtuber with 65k subscribers known for
uploading level showcases, uploaded a video onto his youtube channel showing off a 2.5
minute long layout he made entitled "Vulture". Indicating in the title and description of the
video, that qMystic, a gfx artist known for making a lot of geometry dash thumbnails and for
hosting the level "Gumshot", has bought the layout for $120.

This sparked a discussion in the GD community, some claiming it to be the start of
something new, and some simply calling qMystic a moron for buying it.. A known creator
named Mindcap [tweeted](https://twitter.com/MindCap_/status/1498691901381394432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) about the situation, saying that he was offered more than $1000 for
his upcoming level "Limbo".

> people offered me trifold that money for limbo and one of them offered a 4 digit number to take ownership when I temporarily gave up on the level, and my reply was always a > >fuck you
> 
><cite>MindCap</cite>

And the youtuber Alias had a series on his channel where he hired layout creators and
decorators from Fiverr.

So maybe buying levels isn't a new concept afterall.

Besides all of that, I am very excited to see where qMystic is going to take the level, as he
hosted "Gumshot", a level that went viral in the gd community for it's funny name and very
fun gameplay.
